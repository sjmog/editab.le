oil

There it hangs,

A grey cloud in the sky

Rumptious that we have moved it from its slumber

Deep in the ground


And burned it


Now turning water to acid

Vengeful


We awoke and we thought

That we were the only ones

When in fact we were the last.

How Jupiter and Mars laughed

For they had become dust

Their civilisation
